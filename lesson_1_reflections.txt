How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can focus on the different part of the files in which I may introduce the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can know what I have done every day and I can easily roll back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git is very convenient.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is more efficient.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log can see recent commit, and git diff can see the difference between current code and the code in the git repository.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can roll back too earlier version anytime I want.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control.

Commit manually: more flexible.  Save auto:cannot control, may can not compile.
